# Smart Attendance

***Overview***

Developed an intelligent attendance system using facial recognition technology to automate the process of marking attendance. The system identifies and verifies students in real-time through a webcam, logging their attendance based on recognized faces.

***Key Features***

Facial Recognition: Utilizes face_recognition library for detecting and recognizing faces.

Real-Time Processing: Processes video feed from a webcam to detect and recognize students.

Attendance Logging: Records attendance in a CSV file with timestamps for each recognized student.

Text-to-Speech: Provides vocal confirmation of recognized students using pyttsx3.

User Feedback: Displays recognized faces with bounding boxes and names on the video feed.

***Technologies Used***

Python: Programming language for development.

OpenCV: For image and video processing.

face_recognition: For facial recognition and encoding.

pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion.

***Results***

The application efficiently automates attendance marking by recognizing faces in real-time, reducing manual effort and ensuring accurate records. It integrates facial recognition with user feedback to enhance the attendance management process.
